# Basics

I hope that Dan Abramov will forgive me to paraphrase [this part from Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/index.html):

_Don’t be fooled by all the fancy talk about actions, reducers, state and streams — RxR is incredibly simple. If you’ve ever built a Redux application, you will feel right at home. If you’re new to RxJS, RxR or Redux, it’s easy too!_

In this guide, we’ll walk through similarities between Redux and RxR.

* [Actions and Streams](ActionsStreams.md)
* [Reducers](Reducers.md)
* [Store or State?](StoreState.md)
* [Using With React](UsingWithReact.md)
