# Status

In this docs I put Redux and RxJS side by side here to get into RxJS.

There are simple modules [RxR](https://github.com/dacz/rxr) and [RxR-React](https://github.com/dacz/rxr-react) packages to start easy. Here we can see how it works.

Very soon I'll add the complete example written in Redux and RxR and update accordingly these pages.

More is on [wishlist](./Wishlist.md).

It is work in progress...
