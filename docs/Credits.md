This text and approach is heavily based (and some parts copied) on [amazing article of Michal Zalecki](http://michalzalecki.com/use-rxjs-with-react/).

I cannot give enough kudos and appreciations to [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) and not just for [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and it's amazing tutorials but for all good he does for React and javascript community at all.

And of course my deep respect to everyone who brings us [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs).
