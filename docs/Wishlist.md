# Wish-list

I plan to work on (and you can help, too):

* better docs, better docs, better docs
* example app (Redux and RxR) to demonstrate that it is really easy to rewrite and demonstrate async
* combineReducersWithStructure and createMessageStreamsWithStructure (and find shorter names for them) so messageStreams and it's reducers may maintain their own separate parts of the state (but is has to work with Immutable somehow)
* DevTools
* logger (and generally easy adding the middleware)
* react router example (and if needed some helpers)
* recipes (universal app, CRUD, ...)

The order may not be accurate.
