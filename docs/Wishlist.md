# Wish-list

I plan to work on (and you can help, too):

- [ ] better docs (ongoing and never ending)
- [x] example app (Redux and RxR) to demonstrate that it is really easy to rewrite
- [x] scoped state
- [x] logger and monitor (actions and state)
- [ ] react router example
- [ ] DevTools
- [ ] optimize building (import only what's needed from RxJS)
- [x] blueprint for an app

The order may not be accurate and the list is not complete :)
