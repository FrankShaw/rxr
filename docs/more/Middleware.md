# Middleware

_TODO_

It's easy to subscribe to state changes and even messages that are pushed to reducer. You get stream of state changes and you can log them to console or do whatever you want. I plan to add simple logger.

I plan to add a way how to add middleware that may change createState reducer behavior (to be able to stop some messages etc). I like thing simple and straightforward and I did not hit yet the need to do it.
