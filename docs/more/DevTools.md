# DevTools

Added basic console logging tool at least - read [`createLoggerStream`](../api/createLoggerStream.md) for more info.



It's still far from DevTools but usable.

**Do you want to pick up the challenge and port ReduxDevTools to RxR?**

It' doesn't have to have (yet) time travel, but it would be nice to have nice interface the Redux Monitors have. In the stream described here are all informations - state changes and (very soon) all events in the messageStreams and even you can add your own streams you want to monitor/log. Just add them to the [`createLoggerStream`](../api/createLoggerStream.md)
